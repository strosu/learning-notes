### Intro

- The goal is to get a better understanding of the types of tools available for data storage and manipulation. 
- Any database can be used to store any data, just like you can use a screwdriver to nail a nail. Just because you can use them does not make them the right tools for the job
- By understanding what each type of database is best at, it allows us to build systems that are simpler and better aligned with the current requirements
